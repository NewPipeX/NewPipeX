## Fork Notice
Please note that this is **a fork** of `polymorphicshade`'s popular [NewPipe fork](https://github.com/polymorphicshade/NewPipe) which originally integrated [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) and [Return YouTube Dislike](https://returnyoutubedislike.com/) functionality.

This fork was created after learning that the original fork had its repository archived and will no longer be maintained (as of Dec 29, 2023).

This fork will primarily be maintained to pull in the latest features from upstream NewPipe if/when new versions of NewPipe are released. PRs for anything else are always welcome.

# NewPipe x SponsorBlock x Return YouTube Dislike
A fork of [NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe) with [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) and [Return YouTube Dislike](https://returnyoutubedislike.com/) functionality.

## How can I get this?

### For versions prior to `v0.26.0`
Currently, a couple of `polymorphicshade`'s original builds are still available via `IzzyOnDroid`:
[<img alt="Get it on IzzyOnDroid" height="80" src="https://gitlab.com/IzzyOnDroid/repo/-/raw/master/assets/IzzyOnDroid.png">](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/org.polymorphicshade.newpipe)

### For versions after `v0.26.0`
New builds will be uploaded in the [Releases](https://github.com/javulticat/NewPipe/releases) section. Please download the APK from the newest release and install it on your device.

## Why isn't this in upstream NewPipe?
[The developer team](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe) behind the official NewPipe decided that they do not want to include these kinds of functionality in their app. See https://newpipe.schabi.org/blog/pinned/newpipe-and-online-advertising/, https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/3205, and https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/7469 for more information and discussion.

## Bugs
Please do not report bugs encountered while using this fork to the upstream developers. Either try to reproduce the bug in vanilla NewPipe and then report it (preferred) or [create a bug report in our repo](https://github.com/javulticat/NewPipe/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md).
